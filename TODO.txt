TODO List
=========

Debexpo shortcomings
--------------------

Try to support i18n from the start, and keep doing it.
Let several people upload the same package without clobbering each other.
Understand that there are several suites to which upload packages.
Keep in mind whatever is on the debexpo bug tracker :
https://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=413115&group_id=100127&func=browse

Core functionality
------------------

We need this to get feature-parity with what's currently working on mentors.d.n

 - User profiles (extend the django user profile, or create a secondary one?)
   → GPG
 - Package management
   → Storage
   → Upload processing
   → QA checks (most likely done asynchronously using celery)
   → Repository generation
   → Post-real-upload cleanups (using UDD?)
 - Comment management
   → Per-package
   → with some kind of karma system
 - Subscriptions/Sponsorship queues

Supplementary functionality
---------------------------

 - News module for the frontpage
 - A way to manage the "content" pages without editing templates?
 - Inline review
   → Think about this when working on the package storage
 - Per-team review queues
 - "Social" authentication (OpenID, Debian SSO, ...)

Package repository requirements
-------------------------------


< daemonkeeper> Actually, even several users allowing to upload the
                same package in different branches
< daemonkeeper> Or even worse, the same user uploading the same
                package to different branches.



Git repository:
 - single repository for each source package
 - one branch per (person, suite)
 -> allow diffing a wheezy package with the sid one, or two persons' package, etc.
