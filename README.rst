==================
mentors.debian.net
==================

A reboot of mentors.debian.net, using Django.

To use this project follow these steps:

#. Create your working environment
#. Install dependencies
#. Use the Django admin to create the database and run the project

Why start from scratch?
=======================

The Pylons legacy of the previous codebase is hard to bear, and motivation
was (very) low to make it cleaner. This is an attempt at reviving the
project, from a clean slate.

Don't worry, the good parts of the current debexpo codebase will be kept.

Running the project
===================

Please refer to the docs/install.rst file.
